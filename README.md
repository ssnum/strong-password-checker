# Strong Password Checker 

This is a simple password strength checker that checks the overall strength of the user's password to encourage them to increase the complexity of their passwords and login information. It also generates a random password from the computer that includes all the requirements needed to qualify as a strong password. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is another learning project I made while developing my coding skills.

## Features

- generate a random password that fufills the requirements of a strong password
- create a password that fufills requirements of at least 10 characters, at least 1 symbol, at least 1 capital letter, and at least 1 number and change it based on what requirements it does or does not contain
- switch from text input to password input view (eye button)
- a password strength meter (ranging from red to yellow to green) showing the strength of the user's current password

## How to Use it

1. Enter a password in the text input and click the 'Enter' Button. The Requirements will either turn red or green depending on whether or not they are included in the user's password. Reference the strength meter for an overall evaluation of the strength of the password.
2. Continue changing and re-entering the password until all the requirements have been fufilled and the strength marker is in the green section of the strength meter.
3. Click the 'Generate' password button to get a computer created sample password that fufills all criteria for a strong password.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the game by modifying the CSS variables in the style.css file. These variables control colors such as the background color, button color, etc.
